📘 Java Programming Assignment

Welcome to your Java programming assignment! This task is designed to challenge your understanding of Java Collections, Threads, and Object-Oriented Programming principles. The assignment consists of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level is crafted to test your skills progressively.

🟢 Easy Level

Task: Implement an ArrayList to manage employee details.

🛠️ Requirements:

Create a Java program to store employee details: ID, Name, and Salary.

Implement the following operations:

Add a new employee.

Update employee details.

Remove an employee.

Search for an employee by ID or Name.

Display the list of employees in a well-formatted manner.

📍 Expected Output:

Employee List:
1. ID: 101, Name: John Doe, Salary: 50000
2. ID: 102, Name: Jane Smith, Salary: 60000

Enter employee ID to search: 101
Employee Found: ID: 101, Name: John Doe, Salary: 50000

💡 Hint: Use ArrayList<Employee> with custom Employee class and methods.

🟡 Medium Level

Task: Develop a program using the Collection interface to manage a deck of cards.

🛠️ Requirements:

Collect and store cards with their suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and values (A, 2, 3,...,K).

Allow users to input a suit and display all cards of that suit.

Ensure efficient storage and retrieval using Java Collections Framework.

📍 Expected Output:

Enter the symbol (e.g., Hearts): Hearts
Cards in Hearts:
A of Hearts
2 of Hearts
3 of Hearts
...

💡 Hint: Use HashMap<String, List<String>> or similar collection structure.

🔴 Hard Level

Task: Build a multithreaded ticket booking system.

🛠️ Requirements:

Simulate ticket booking with multiple threads.

Ensure no double booking using thread synchronization.

Assign higher priority to VIP bookings.

Display seat allocation status in real-time.

📍 Expected Output:

Booking seat: 5 for VIP User: Alice
Booking seat: 6 for User: Bob
Seat 5 successfully booked by Alice
Seat 6 successfully booked by Bob
...

💡 Hint: Use synchronized keyword and Thread class with setPriority() method.

⚠️ Important Guidelines

Submit clean, well-commented code.

Follow best practices for variable naming and code structure.

Ensure the program runs without errors.

Submit your assignment as a zipped folder containing source code and a README file explaining your approach.

🚀 Good Luck & Happy Coding! 🎯
